# Common VBA Error Handler
### Abstract
A common VBA error handling approach which covers
- Development/Test and Production state of a project
- Application versus VB errors
- The "path to the error" derived from the call stack of the way up from the error source procedure to the entry procedure
- Optional tracing and display of the execution time for any procedure whenever the call stack has come bach to an entry procedure

### Towards error handling
The absolute minimum error handling for me is:

```vbscript
```
